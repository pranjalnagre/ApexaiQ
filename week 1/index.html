            </h2>
            <p>IT asset mChatGPT said:
            In cybersecurity, a perimeter refers to the boundary that separates an organization’s internal network from external networks, such as the internet. It defines the point at which security controls are applied to monitor, control, and protect traffic entering or leaving the network.anagement (also known as ITAM) is the process of ensuring an organization’s assets are
                accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. Put simply, it’s
                making sure that the valuable items, tangible and intangible, in your organization are tracked and being
                used. </p>
            <p>An IT asset includes hardware, software systems, or information an organization values</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Physical assets — laptops, desktops, servers, networking equipment, mobile devices, etc.</li>
                <li>Digital assets — software licenses, cloud subscriptions, SaaS tools, and digital data.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Companies need IT Asset Management (ITAM) software because it:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Single source of truth :</b> Centralizes all asset data in one place, avoids confusion, errors,
                    and duplicate tracking.</li>
                <li><b>Reduce waste & save costs :</b> Better use of assets, no overspending on licenses or unused
                    resources.</li>
                <li><b>Boost productivity & reliability :</b> Helps deliver services faster while keeping systems
                    stable.</li>
                <li><b>Support ITSM & compliance :</b> Strengthens processes, ensures legal/security compliance.</li>

            <h2>4. Why is ApexaiQ an agentless platform?
            </h2>
            <p>Apexa iQ is called an agentless platform because it does not require installing software agents on every
                device to collect asset data.Instead, it connects directly to existing systems and tools (like Active
                Directory, cloud platforms, endpoint management, and security tools) to pull data remotely.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Faster deployment :</b> no need to install agents on thousands of devices.</li>
                <li><b>Lower overhead :</b> reduces performance impact on endpoints.</li>
                <li><b>Less maintenance :</b> no agent updates or compatibility issues.</li>
                <li><b>Broader coverage :</b> can monitor assets that don’t support agents (like IoT, printers, network
                    gear).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Apexa iQ is agentless because it collects asset and risk data remotely through integrations and APIs,
                rather than relying on software installed on each device.</p>
            <p>
                <b>How It Works</b>
            </p>
            <p>Within an organization, security tools feed data to the ApexaiQ Collector through an Accelerator,
                enabling seamless asset discovery. The Collector gathers raw asset data without the need for endpoint
                agents, ensuring a lightweight and efficient process. Before reaching the ApexaiQ SaaS Dashboard,
                pre-feed rules automatically process and normalize this incoming data. Post-feed rules then further
                refine and enrich the processed feed, categorizing it into devices, users, and software inventories.
                Enrichment rules allow organizations to add context and custom inputs to the collected data, while
                integration capabilities enable two-way communication with existing security tools, ensuring a
                continuous and dynamic flow of asset intelligence.</p>

            <h2>5. Cybersecurity.</h2>
            <p><b>What is Cybersecurity</b></p>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
                cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
                money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
            <p><b>Why cybersecurity is important?</b></p>
            <p>1. Cyberattacks can cause identity theft, extortion, or data loss for individuals.</p>
            <p>2. Personal data like photos and documents can be permanently lost.</p>
            <p>3. Everyone depends on critical infrastructure (power plants, hospitals, banks).</p>
            <p>4. Securing organizations is vital to protect society’s daily functioning.</p>
            <p>5. Advanced cybersecurity solutions benefit both individuals and organizations.</p>
            <p><b>Types of cybersecurity threats</b></p>
            <p><b>1. Cloud Security:</b> Protects apps, data, and users in hybrid/multicloud setups; provides rapid
                threat detection, visibility, and scalability without reducing productivity.
                Examples: Cisco Cloud Protection Suite, Multicloud Defense, Cloud Application Security</p>
            <p><b>2. Identity Security:</b> Safeguards digital identities and manages access.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Authenticate users</li>

                <li>Authorize resources</li>

                <li>Monitor suspicious activity</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Examples: Cisco Identity Intelligence, Continuous Identity Security</p>
            <p><b>3. Malware: </b> Malicious software that causes damage or unauthorized
                <br>
                Examples: Secure Endpoint
            </p>
            <p><b>4. Phishing: </b> Fake emails to steal sensitive data (e.g., logins, credit card info).
                <br>
                Examples: Cisco Secure Email
            </p>
            <p><b>5. Ransomware:</b> Blocks access to files/systems until ransom is paid (not always recoverable).</p>
            <p><b>6. Social Engineering:</b> Tricks users into revealing information or clicking harmful links; often
                combined with phishing or malware.</p>
            <p><b>7. Threat Detection (XDR): </b> Integrates tools for better visibility, detection, and faster incident
                response.
                <br>
                Examples: Cisco XDR
            </p>
            <p><b>8.Zero Trust:</b> Security strategy ensuring no user/device is trusted by default. Uses MFA, device
                checks, ZTNA, and network segmentation.</p>

                <p>The Apexa iQ Score is a risk-based rating that shows how healthy and secure an organization’s IT
                    environment is.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It’s calculated using real-time asset data, including hardware, software, firmware,
                        vulnerabilities, configurations, EOL/EOS status, and compliance gaps.</li>
                    <li>The score helps companies quickly understand their overall security posture and technical debt.
                    </li>
                    <li>A higher score = lower risk and better IT hygiene, while a lower score = more vulnerabilities,
                        outdated assets, or compliance issues.</li>
                    <li>It’s designed to give IT and security teams a simple, measurable way to track progress and
